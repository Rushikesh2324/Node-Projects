# Node-Projects
This project creates a Node.js bot integrated with Zoom, using speech-to-text and GPT-3 for voice-based interaction. It converts voice input to text, generates responses, and converts them back to speech. Grading includes requirements, deployment, responsiveness, and code quality. Enables interactive communication in Zoom meetings.
